This project invites participants to utilize their data science skills to explore and analyze the NYC OpenData Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset. As you engage with the project, you'll progress through a series of milestones, each designed to equip you with new knowledge and techniques:

Milestone 1: Data Preparation

Get familiar with the project environment and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Learn how to access and explore the NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset.
Understand basic data analysis techniques like data cleaning and descriptive statistics.

Milestone 2: Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration

Delve into data ethics, considering potential biases and how they might impact analysis.
Identify and handle missing values within the dataset.
Analyze crash data, discovering the top contributing factors, vehicle types involved, and crash types.
Visualize your findings using bar charts and explore relationships between variables.
Milestone 3: Time Series Analysis

Gain insights into trends, seasonality, and residuals of the data through time series analysis.
Create visualizations to understand how crashes fluctuate over time, including hourly and monthly variations.
Analyze the potential impact of COVID-19 on crash frequency.

Milestone 4: Geospatial Analysis

Leverage geospatial techniques to explore the spatial distribution of crashes across NYC boroughs.
Create a heatmap to visualize areas with high crash concentrations.
Utilize interactive maps to visualize crash severity based on injuries and fatalities.

Milestone 5: Self-Guided Research Question

Formulate your own research question related to transportation safety and data analysis.
Employ the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the project to answer your question.
Create impactful visualizations, models, or analyses to support your findings.
